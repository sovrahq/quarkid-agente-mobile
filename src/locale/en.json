QuarkID wallet allows the user to own, manage, and securely share their verifiable identity credentials issued by different entities\nThe Key Management System (KMS) constitutes one of the most basic and essential capabilities of an Identity Wallet, as it allows the generation and storage of public and private key pairs, ensures the protection of private keys, and facilitates digital signing through various cryptographic algorithms.\n You need to create a DID and manage the keys within your device to start interacting within QuarkID, through QuarkID wallet. Whenever you use or validate verifiable credentials, you are responsible for providing accurate information and maintaining the security of your account.\n By accepting these Terms, you commit to using QuarkID wallet legally and appropriately. This includes, but is not limited to, not using QuarkID wallet for illegal activities, negatively interfering with the operation of QuarkID, or accessing wallets associated with an identity that is not your own, among other behaviors.\n QuarkID is open-source, which means that the source code is available for anyone to review, modify, and distribute according to the applicable license.

Changing the keys periodically reduces the risk of the keys being compromised and used to access personal data or carry out unauthorized actions."

It then creates a file containing all this important information. You have control to decide where you want to save this file on your device. This feature provides you with a secure way to back up and transport your essential identity and cryptographic data for use on other devices or in recovery situations."
